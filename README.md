Label Based Access Control (LaBAC)
=====

What is LaBAC?

LaBAC is a simplified type of Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC). Where in ABAC there can be many attributes, in LaBAC there is only one attribute associated with object (named object-label) and one attribute associated with User (called user-label). As this access Control is based on label, I call it Label Based Access Control or LaBAC.
